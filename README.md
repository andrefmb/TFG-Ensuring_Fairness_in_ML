Repository for my Bachelor's thesis about an experimental study of different counterfactual equity models. I have made an implementation in Python, based on the models presented in Matt Kusner's paper.

## Description

My Bachelor's thesis, Herramientas para Garantizar Justicia en Aprendizaje Autom√°tico, proposes as a challenge, after an exhaustive study of the existing bibliography and tools on the subject, to carry out a comparative analysis in Python that includes fairness evaluations of all the families and visualisations for the interpretation of results and models.

Likewise, this thesis will mathematically analyse the definitions of various measures of fairness and justice, demonstrating their properties, limitations and possible incompatibilities (impossibility theorem of fairness), exploring the different options for improving the results obtained by means of a process of machine learning in the terms previously proposed.

To do so, we will start by carrying out an exhaustive review of the different mathematical formalisations of the concept of fairness in the literature, analysing the advantages and disadvantages of each one both from a theoretical point of view and in terms of their practical implementation in specific classification problems by means of automatic learning. In addition, a study and classification of the most popular published algorithms that work with fairness will be carried out and a study of the advantages and disadvantages of each one will be made.
